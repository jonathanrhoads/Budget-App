## Concept Description
The purpose of the app is to help individuals overview their spending to make better financial decisions. Just the act of writing down what you spend is enough to help you become wiser with your money. The app will focus on awareness through logging purchases and monthly expenses. The goal is to create an application with modular code that can be easily transferred to a mobile application.
